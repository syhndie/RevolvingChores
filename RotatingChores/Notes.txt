Next:


	make chore name/user unique in the database and enforce with code

	make all messages consistent with basepagemodel

	change checkbox icon to star for high priority chores

	check sort order for chores (should be high priority and due/overdue, sorted by due date; followed by regular priority, sorted by due date)

	If I deploy the site, I need to register the new public url from the Google Console.
