	deleted user when still logged in gets wonky - need to fix it so that the user gets logged out when the user no longer exists
		the user can still create chores, etc. but account management pages give an useful error message (they do not throw an exception)
	change email page changes email but not username - then login asks for email, but really is using username 
		also, no success or dangermessage when changing email address

	alt titles for buttons/links
	index page - description and instructions
	move most of the code for centering to the layout
	external authentication
	two factor authentication
