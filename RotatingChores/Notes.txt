	is there a way to block the browser from doing autocomplete?

	should be required to put in password to change your email

	Chore
	Name
	FrequencyNumber
	FrequencyValue
	IsHighPriority
	Notes
	DueDate
	DateCreated
	DateLastModified

Chore Create/Edit form has 
		Name
		FrequencyNumber
		FrequencyValue
		IsHighPriority
		Notes
		DueDate
		
DueDate is used to sort Chores Index table

When you click the "i did it today" button, the DueDate automatically updates,
based on FrequencyNumber and FrequencyValue, and today's date

You can always edit the DueDate, by using the Chore Edit page

        {
            get
            {
                DateTime lastDate = DateLastCompleted != null ? (DateTime)DateLastCompleted : DateLastModiied;
                return FrequencyUnits switch
                {
                    TimeIntervals.days => lastDate.AddDays(FrequencyValue),
                    TimeIntervals.weeks => lastDate.AddDays(FrequencyValue * 7),
                    TimeIntervals.months => lastDate.AddMonths(FrequencyValue),
                    TimeIntervals.years => lastDate.AddYears(FrequencyValue),
                    _ => throw new ArgumentException("Chore has invalid Frequency Unit"),
                };
            }
        }
