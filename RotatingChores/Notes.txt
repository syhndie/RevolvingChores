every chore has a date last completed.
every chore has a field to indicate how frequently the chore should be done
a due date can be calculated for each chore, based on these two fields
the index page will be a list of chores
the primary sort order will be on due date, ascending
if a chore is overdue, it will be listed in red
maybe there should be a priority field that can provide a secondary sort order? - low, med, high; or normal, high; or high priority?: yes, no
or, maybe secondary sort order should be based on frequency - more frequent chores get precendence over less frequent ones - this could be tertiary sort order

the list should be searchable via datatables, but not orderable - because that could be confusing when sort order is so important to the presentation

	id - int, required
	userid - string, required
	name - string, required

	description? notes? maybe this would only show on the details and/or edit page?, optional
